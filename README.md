# Smoker-prediction-ML
This project is designed to develop a machine learning model that can identify whether an individual is a smoker or not. The model will use various features such as age, gender, and other demographic factors to predict whether an individual is a smoker.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of demographic and lifestyle data from individuals. The dataset contains a total of 55,692 samples, with each sample consisting of several demographic and lifestyle features, as well as a label indicating whether the individual is a smoker or not.

# Data Preprocessing
Before developing the machine learning model, the dataset will be preprocessed to clean and transform the data. The preprocessing steps will include data cleaning, and feature scaling, and splitting to prepare the data for modeling.

# Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model will be developed using the scikit-learn library in Python. We have used Lazy_classifier library to get an overview of model performances. We used 3 different algorithms such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bays to develop the model. After tuning hypter-parameters, models will be trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a holdout test set to measure their performance.

# Results
The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using F1-score metric. We will also use visualization techniques to help understand the model's performance and gain insights into the dataset.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to identify smokers based on demographic and lifestyle factors. The machine learning model developed can be used to predict whether an individual is a smoker or not with high accuracy. The project can be extended to develop more sophisticated models that can capture more complex relationships between the features and the smoking behavior.
